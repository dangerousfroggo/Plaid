ai usage:  
-- '/success' page is written largely by gpt (ran out of time to code by hand), prompt: given a list of objects with the following attributes: [insert attributes], create a page that displays the objects and their attributes one by one  
-- 'index' page has been modified by gpt (prompt: improve styling of form fields)  
-- the entire main.py file has been overlooked by chatgpt for potential errors, vulnerabilities or weird behaviours, but does NOT USE ANY gpt-written code except where stated. however, gpt's suggestions were used to improve the code  
-- find_places function is written by gpt. NOT actually currently used in code, was used to see if gpt's function wouldn't have an issue with keywords like the non gpt function (still had issue, hence didnt use function but kept in code for potential future use)  
-- gmaps_createSuiotablePlaceTypes has been modified by gpt (prompt: do you have any ideas why this [current function] returns NO_RESULTS for any inputs except 'restaraunts'), gpt fixed an issue with overloading
